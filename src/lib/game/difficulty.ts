// PortMasters 2 Parallel Release: difficulty modes
//
// One data record defines every difficulty tier, and a thin layer of pure
// selectors derives each in-game dial from it. This mirrors the original
// PortMasters 2 design (a single DIFFICULTIES record plus difficultyRules
// helpers), rebuilt around the Parallel Release's own systems.
//
// Difficulty is a ROOM property (see Room.difficulty in prisma/schema.prisma):
// the host picks it once, and every captain in the harbor resolves the same
// tier. Because the tier and the round number are the only inputs to every
// selector here, and both are identical for everyone in a room, each
// captain's seeded market and orders keep their own personal draw while the
// structure (how many cards, how likely a raid) stays consistent room wide.
//
// The "fair_winds" tier is calibrated to the game exactly as it played before
// difficulty existed: 8 rounds, a flat 0.2 raid chance, a 0.1 escort fee, 6
// cards on each board, no mandates and no corrupt brokers. Those numbers used
// to be flat constants in ./constants; moving them here changed nothing for
// the existing mode, and it is what lets the two richer tiers vary them.
// See docs/DIFFICULTY_MODES_PROPOSAL.md.
