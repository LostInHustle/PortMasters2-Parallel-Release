// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2 Parallel Release: Lords of the Silk Road game engine
//
// Ported faithfully from the original single-player build. All wording,
// log messages, balance, and phase flow are preserved verbatim.
//
// [ONLINE EXTENSION] The one behavioural addition is a seedable PRNG
// (mulberry32) used for the session economy. Port market cards, trade
// orders, and the Broker's intel pool are generated deterministically from
// (roomId + userId + voyageEpoch + round), so each captain has their own
// market, orders, and intel: reproducible on reload, different from every
// other captain, and rerolled into a brand-new voyage whenever the host
// restarts (which bumps voyageEpoch, see prisma/schema.prisma and
// src/lib/use-game-session.ts). Each captain's gold, reputation, inventory,
// workers, and personal luck (Salvage Crane refunds, Tax-Evasion audits,
// boon offerings) are their own too.
//
// One new gameplay skill, Broker's Favor, is layered on top of the faithful
// port: a Renown-gated, once-per-voyage guaranteed buyer (see
// callBrokersFavor). It draws with a captain's own live randomness, so it
// stays personal and never perturbs their seeded market.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// This file is now a barrel. The engine itself lives in ./engine/*, one
// module per subsystem, matching how ./backing.ts, ./convoy.ts and the
// rest of this directory were already organised. Nothing moved between
// subsystems and no behaviour changed; the split is purely about where
// the code sits.
//
// The barrel exists so that the twenty five files importing
// `@/lib/game/engine` never had to change, and so that this stays the one
// public entry point to the engine. Import from here, not from the
// individual modules, unless you are inside ./engine/ yourself.
//
// The dependency flow is one way and worth preserving:
//
//   core            no dependencies, used by nearly everything
//   pricing         core
//   market          core, pricing
//   orders          core, pricing, market
//   workers         core, pricing
//   barter          core
//   pirates         core
//   aid             owns the shared helper Reputation ceiling
//   backingState    aid
//   convoyState     no engine dependencies
//   boons           market
//   lifecycle       imports from nearly all of the above, and nothing
//                   imports from it
//
// Only lifecycle sits at the top, because only lifecycle sequences the
// others. Adding an import that points back down into it would create the
// first cycle in the engine, so please don't.
