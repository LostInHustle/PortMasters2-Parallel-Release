// =====================================================================
// PortMasters 2 Parallel Release: Captain's Merits
// One-time, account-wide achievement badges, a third strand of persistent
// progression alongside Renown (see legacy.ts) and Daily Check-In (see
// checkin.ts). Pure functions only (no React, no Prisma), so both the
// client (the trophy row in CaptainLegacyCard) and the server (the voyage
// conclusion check in src/server/realtime.ts, the only place a merit is
// ever granted) share the exact same rules for what counts.
//
// Unlike Renown XP and Check-In rewards, a merit carries no gameplay
// power of its own, purely bragging rights, so this list can grow freely
// without ever touching the voyage economy.
