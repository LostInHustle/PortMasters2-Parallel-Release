<p>It is the easiest way to recover from a bad draw. All Tea and no Silk, with a Sachet order already on the board? Someone else in the harbor has probably drawn the opposite problem.</p>

🌊 These Waters: ${cfg.icon} ${cfg.name}
${cfg.summary}

🚢 Objective:
Travel ${cfg.rounds} voyages, accumulate wealth and reputation!

📦 Goods System:
Raw Materials: Hemp(3-6💰), Silk(6-10💰), Tea(10-14💰)
Finished Goods: Linen Clothes(30-42💰), Cotton Clothes(50-65💰),
Brocade(70-90💰), Sachet(95-120💰)

👥 Worker System:
• Weaver (8 Gold/Round): Makes Linen or Cotton Clothes
• Master (12 Gold/Round): Makes Linen, Cotton or Brocade
• Sachet Maker (20 Gold/Round): Makes Sachets

🧾 Tax System:
• VAT: 5% on finished product profit margin
• Income Tax: 10% on voyage net profit

🔮 Broker's Whisper:
• Phase 1: Click "Broker's Rumor Board" to open the window
• Spend 5 Gold to buy a "rumor" about Phase 2 demand
• Revealed intel guarantees matching orders will appear
• A rumor is always true and always delivered, on every tier${cfg.brokerCorruption ? `\n• Here a broker may still be corrupt: you get the true rumor, but your position leaks and this round's raid risk rises, and the log tells you when` : ""}

🤝 Bartering:
• Right after Phase 1, before Phase 2 opens: trade directly with the other captains in your harbor
• Post what you have and what you want for it; anyone can accept it with one click
• An offer can't be an item for itself, and both amounts must be whole numbers of at least 1
• You can never offer more than you currently own, it's set aside the moment you post, and returned to you if you cancel or nobody takes it
• Want to make sure a specific captain gets your offer, not whoever clicks fastest? Pick their name under "With" when you post: only the two of you will ever see it

🔧 Ship Modules (NEW!):
• Phase 4: Upgrade your ship to unlock Module Slots
• Draft powerful modules to create unique synergies
• Swap modules to adapt to your current run!

🏴‍☠️ Pirates and Escorts:
• Phase 3, before the bills below: ${raidCopy(cfg)} of losing every Gold coin you're carrying
• Hire an escort for ${escortPct(cfg)} of your current Gold to guarantee safe passage instead
• The choice has to be made before that round's pirates are rolled for
${mandates.length ? `\n📜 Imperial Mandates:\n• On voyage${mandates.length === 1 ? "" : "s"} ${mandates.join(", ")} the Emperor commissions one large order at a fixed reward\n• A mandate is the only order exempt from VAT\n• Every captain in the harbor is dealt the same mandate, so it is a race\n` : ""}

📣 Word on the Docks:
• Whichever captain is first in the harbor to complete ${WORD_ON_THE_DOCKS_THRESHOLD} trade orders total this voyage wins ${WORD_ON_THE_DOCKS_REWARD} Gold on the spot
• It's a race against the rest of the room, not a scheduled event: it can land on any round, for any captain
• Announced to the whole harbor the moment it's won, same as any other harbor wide milestone

🌊 Tidewatch Alerts:
• Once everyone in the harbor's own Reputation adds up past ${TIDEWATCH_SURGE_THRESHOLD}, the harbor takes notice of a bustling crew
• From the next Port Purchase onward, every captain's board gets one extra cargo lot, for the rest of the voyage
• This never changes your voyage length or which tier's goods you see, only how busy the market gets

⚓ Convoy Ventures:
• Found on the Dues tab of your captain's rail: any captain can post a venture, a Gold target and a deadline round
• Anyone in the harbor, including the poster, can chip in Gold toward that target at any time before the deadline
• Reach the target in time and it fills: every contributor is paid back ${Math.round((CONVOY_VENTURE_PAYOUT_MULTIPLIER - 1) * 100)}% more Gold than they put in, split in exact proportion to their share
• Miss the deadline and it fails: every contributor only gets back ${Math.round(CONVOY_VENTURE_FAILURE_REFUND_RATE * 100)}% of their own stake, the rest is lost
• Contributing is a real wager on the rest of the harbor coming through, not a free favor
• Your whole harbor only ever gets one filled venture per voyage: the moment any venture fills, every other open venture is cancelled and fully refunded, and posting a new one is disabled until the next voyage
• A deadline can never land on your voyage's final round: it always leaves at least one full round afterward to actually spend whatever you're paid
• No single captain can ever fund more than ${Math.round(CONVOY_VENTURE_MAX_CONTRIBUTOR_SHARE * 100)}% of a venture's target alone: it always needs at least one other captain to fund the rest before it can fill

🆘 Financial Aid:
• Can't cover this round's wages or maintenance? Ask the harbor for a loan, right on the settlement screen
• Any captain with enough Gold can lend it to you on the spot; it's in your hands immediately
• Repay it any time before the voyage's last round ends, or it's taken from your funds automatically and handed to your lender
• Still short when the voyage finishes? That unpaid loan is what bankrupts you, not the round it was borrowed in
• Lending Gold raises your own reputation, scaled to how much you lent

🛡️ Backing:
• Every outstanding loan in your harbor is visible on the settlement screen, to everyone, not just the lender and borrower
• A third captain can back one: pledge some of their own Gold as a safety net for the lender, escrowed the instant they pledge it
• Only spent if the loan actually defaults, and only up to whatever was pledged; the lender still eats any shortfall past that
• Never called on when the loan is repaid in full? The whole pledge comes back, plus a small Reputation bonus for the risk paying off
• One backer per loan; you can't back a loan you're the lender or borrower on yourself

Captain's Legacy:
• Every voyage's final Reputation becomes Renown XP on your account the moment the voyage ends, win or lose
• Renown is permanent: it survives a restart and carries into every future voyage, in any harbor, unlike Gold, cargo, and ship level
• Each Renown level grants a small Gold bonus at the start of your next fresh voyage
• Whoever ends a voyage with the highest Reputation among everyone who reached the endgame screen is crowned Sea Master
• Check your current Renown level, title, and Sea Master crowns any time from the Lobby

🌊 Voyage Phases:
1. Port Purchase: buy resources at ports (plus Broker rumors)
   ↳ Bartering window opens right after, before Trade Transaction
2. Trade Transaction: complete orders
3. Settlement: pirates may strike first, then wages and maintenance come due (ask for a loan if you're short)
4. Upgrade: improve ships and install modules

  return `⚓ Avoiding Bankruptcy Strategies:

💰 Financial Management:
1. Always maintain reserve funds for expenses
2. Maintenance + Wages are fixed rounds costs
3. Calculate total expenditure before buying

👥 Worker Management:
1. Weaver Wage: ${WAGES.weaver} Gold / Round
2. Master Wage: ${WAGES.master} Gold / Round
3. Maker Wage: ${WAGES.sachet_maker} Gold / Round
4. Hire only as needed

🔮 Broker's Whisper Strategy:
1. Buy rumors early if you have spare gold
2. Hoard revealed items to guarantee Phase 2 profits
3. Balance intel purchases with other investments

🛒 Buying Strategy:
1. Reserve funds for maintenance+wages first
2. Select high value-for-money goods
3. Prioritize port specialties + revealed intel

🔄 Bartering Strategy:
1. Trade away surplus raw materials for the one you're actually short on
2. A modest Gold offer can secure a needed item faster than waiting on next voyage's market
3. Cancel an offer that's sitting unclaimed if you'd rather keep the material yourself

🤝 Trading Strategy:
1. Prioritize highest profit orders
2. Consider freight impact on margins
3. Finished orders yield high profit but incur VAT

⚠️ Risk Control:
1. Calculate fixed round costs: Maintenance + Wages
2. Keep funds consistently > fixed costs
3. Avoid over-expansion cash flow issues

🏴‍☠️ Pirates and Escorts:
1. The escort fee scales with your own Gold, so it's relatively cheap exactly when you're poor and the stakes are also low
2. Hire one when you're carrying enough Gold that losing it would actually hurt
3. Sailing without one is a fair bet when you have little to lose anyway

🆘 Borrowing and Lending:
1. Repay a loan as soon as you can afford it, instead of waiting for it to be deducted automatically at Round ${cfg.rounds}
2. Lending Gold raises your own reputation, so helping a captain who can clearly repay you is rarely a bad trade
3. Watch how much you've lent out across the voyage; it's still your Gold until it's actually repaid

🛡️ Backing Strategy:
1. Back a loan you'd have happily lent Gold on yourself; you're taking on the same risk without earning the lender's own full reputation rate
2. Only pledge what you can afford to lose outright, the same rule as lending directly
3. A loan to a captain who's clearly about to turn a profit is a safer backing bet than one taken late in the voyage with little runway left to repay it
