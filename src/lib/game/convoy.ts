// =====================================================================
// [MANIFEST 04: Convoy Ventures] Pure decision logic, split out of
// src/server/realtime.ts for the same reason computeHarborPulse was split
// out into harborPulse.ts: this is real Gold math and the one exploit
// prevention rule (one filled venture per voyage, room wide) that a
// doctored client or a race between two captains has to actually be safe
// against, and none of it can be unit tested while it sits nested inside
// attachRealtime's socket closures, where nothing outside a live server
// with a live database could import or exercise it.
//
// The server (src/server/realtime.ts) is still the one authority over
// *when* each of these run and over the one check that genuinely can't be
// pure, hasRoomClaimedVenture, which has to ask the database whether any
// venture in this room's voyage has ever reached "filled". Everything here
// is a plain function of its arguments: parse a stored JSON blob, total a
// contribution map, decide how much of a contribution a venture can
// actually use, decide a settlement's payout rate and per-contributor
// amounts, and decide the valid deadline window for a fresh post.
