// =====================================================================
// [MANIFEST 01: The Harbor Pulse] Pure market-pricing formula, split out of
// src/server/realtime.ts (the same reason pools.ts was split out of
// difficulty.ts): this is real-money math that decides every captain's next
// round's prices, and it belongs next to the rest of the pure game logic in
// src/lib/game/ rather than nested inside attachRealtime's socket closures,
// where nothing outside a live server could import or unit test it without
// dragging in Prisma/socket.io as a side effect.
//
// The server (src/server/realtime.ts) is still the one authority that owns
// *when* this runs: it tallies every captain's per-round purchase report
// (see addPulseReport there) and calls computeHarborPulse exactly once, the
// moment the room advances into the next round's Phase 1 (see maybeAdvance).
// This module only owns the formula itself.
// =====================================================================

// Turns a round's raw summed quantities into a small per-item price
// multiplier: an item the room leaned into harder than an even three-way
// split gets pricier, one nobody touched gets cheaper. PULSE_CAP bounds it
// to a lean rather than a shove, and an empty or missing tally (round 1, or
// a round nobody reported for) is neutral rather than guessed at.
