// =====================================================================
// [MANIFEST 13: Ledger Integrity Pass] The one narrow guard on the save
// endpoint that currently trusts a client completely.
//
// This project chose, deliberately, to let every client compute its own
// state rather than run an authoritative server, and nothing here reverses
// that. PUT /api/game/state still writes whatever a captain's browser
// reports. What it no longer does is write it without ever asking whether
// the numbers could have come from a real voyage.
//
// The check exists now, before Trading Houses, Ages of the Ledger and
// Captain's Rival, because those three all read account level numbers that
// a doctored save can inflate. A local score was one voyage's problem; a
// permanent house standing built on a forged one is everybody's.
//
// Pure functions only, no Prisma and no Next request handling, for the same
// reason convoy.ts and backing.ts were pulled out of the socket closures:
// so the rule can be exercised by a fast deterministic test instead of only
// against a live server.
