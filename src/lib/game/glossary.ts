  // Raw materials
  Hemp: "A cheap raw material, bought at port. Weavers turn it into Linen Clothes, or combine it with Silk for Cotton Clothes.",
  Silk: "A pricier raw material. Goes into Cotton Clothes, Brocade, and Sachets. Most of the high-value recipes need it.",
  Tea: "A raw material used only in Sachets, alongside Silk.",

  // Finished goods
  "Linen Clothes": "A Weaver's product: 2 Hemp in, one item out. The cheapest finished good to produce.",
  "Cotton Clothes": "A Weaver's product: 2 Hemp + 1 Silk in. Worth more than Linen Clothes, costs more to make.",
  Brocade: "A Master Weaver's product: 3 Silk in. One of the two highest-value finished goods.",
  Sachet: "A Sachet Maker's product: 1 Silk + 2 Tea in. The most valuable finished good, and the only one that needs Tea.",

  // Workers
  Weaver: "Makes Linen Clothes or Cotton Clothes. Costs a wage every round, paid at Phase 3, whether or not they're working.",
  "Master Weaver": "Makes Linen Clothes, Cotton Clothes, or Brocade. Pricier than a Weaver, and the only one who can make Brocade.",
  "Sachet Maker": "Makes Sachets. The most expensive artisan to hire, but Sachets pay the best.",

  // Core stats
  Reputation: "Your score for the voyage, roughly your accumulated trading profit. Highest reputation after round 8 wins.",
  Gold: "Your spendable funds. Hit zero with bills still due and the voyage ends in bankruptcy.",
  VAT: "A 5% tax on the profit margin of finished-good sales (selling price minus material cost minus wage). Raw material sales aren't taxed this way.",
  "Income Tax": "A 10% tax on your net profit for the round, charged at Phase 3 settlement after everything else is paid.",
  Freight: "The shipping fee for completing a trade order, based on how many items you're moving. Reduced by your ship level and certain boons or modules.",
  Maintenance: "A fixed per-round upkeep fee for your ship, due at Phase 3 regardless of how the round went.",
  "Ship Level": "Raises your module slots and gives a flat discount on freight costs. Upgraded from the Shipyard in Phase 4.",
  Wages: "What your hired artisans cost per round, paid at Phase 3 whether they produced anything or not.",
  Boon: "A one-round bonus you draft at the start of each voyage. It's picked personally, so your three choices differ from everyone else's.",
  Module: "A permanent ship upgrade, drafted from the Shipyard once you have a free slot. Stays equipped until you swap it out.",
  Barter: "A short window right after buying where captains trade directly with each other instead of through the market. Post what you have for what you want; the offered amount is set aside the moment you post it, and comes back to you if it's canceled or nobody takes it.",
  "Pirate Attack": "A 20% chance, rolled at Phase 3 before wages and maintenance come due, of losing every Gold coin you're carrying. Hire an escort beforehand to guarantee safe passage instead of risking it.",
  Escort: "Guarantees safe passage from that round's pirate attack, for a cost of 10% of your current Gold. Once hired, the round's pirates are no longer a risk.",
  "Financial Aid": "A loan from another captain when you can't cover this round's wages or maintenance on your own. The lender's Gold transfers to you immediately; you owe it back before the voyage ends, or it's deducted automatically and handed to them at Round 8.",
  Debt: "Gold you owe another captain after taking a loan. Repay it any time before Round 8 ends. If you still can't cover it by then, the amount still owed comes straight out of your funds and you're marked bankrupt when the voyage finishes.",
