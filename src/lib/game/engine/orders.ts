// =====================================================================
// Phase 2, the trade manifest: the orders a captain can fill, what
// filling one actually pays, and the two ways an order can be conjured
// outside the ordinary draw (an Imperial Mandate, or calling in the
// Broker's Favor).
//
// completeOrder is the largest function in the engine and is deliberately
// left whole. Its steps are strictly ordered and the order is the
// behaviour: VAT comes off the original reward before any percentage
// bonus is applied to what remains, freight is charged before the Salvage
// Crane can refund it, and the Broker's commission is taken last of all.
// A past bug came from reordering exactly this sequence and paying every
// crane refund out twice, which is why the cost-ledger true-up in the
// middle carries the comment it does. Splitting it into tidy helpers
// would make that ordering implicit rather than obvious, so it stays as
// one readable top-to-bottom settlement.
//
// The order generators come from ./market: Phase 1 and Phase 2 draw from
// the same seeded deck, so there is exactly one implementation of them.
