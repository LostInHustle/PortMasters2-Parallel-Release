// =====================================================================
// Bartering: swapping goods and Gold directly with another captain,
// outside the market entirely.
//
// The escrow-on-post design is the important part. Posting an offer takes
// the offered goods out of the hold immediately rather than at accept
// time, which is what stops a captain from posting the same stock in two
// offers and having both accepted. Everything that follows (cancel,
// expiry at the end of the phase, and the accepting side) is built around
// that: goods are always in exactly one place, never promised twice.
//
// The offer board itself is shared room state and lives on the server
// (see the barter:* handlers in src/server/realtime.ts). These functions
// are only the local half, moving goods on whichever client they run on.
// Covered by scripts/tests/unit.barter.ts, including the conservation
// invariant across both sides of a completed trade.

// both get accepted. Returns true on success; false (with a log line, no
// state change) if any of the four barter constraints are violated.
