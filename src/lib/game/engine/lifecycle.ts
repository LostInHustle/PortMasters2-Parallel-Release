// =====================================================================
// The voyage's spine: what happens at the end of a round, how the phases
// chain into one another, and how a voyage begins, concludes and restarts.
//
// Everything here is orchestration. Each function's job is to call into
// the subsystems in the right order and move state.phase along, which is
// why this module imports from nearly every sibling and none of them
// import back. That one-way flow is deliberate: the subsystems stay
// independently testable, and the sequencing lives in exactly one place.
//
// nextPhase and snapToCheckpoint are the two dispatch tables. The first
// advances a captain one step from wherever they are; the second drops a
// captain straight onto a given round and phase, which is what lets
// someone joining a room mid voyage land where everyone else already is
// rather than back at round 1.
