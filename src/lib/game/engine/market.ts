// Phase 1, the port market: what a captain may buy this round, what it
// costs them, and the deterministic draw that decides the board.
//
// The generators here are the reason this file matters. They run on a
// seeded RNG (see ../rng) keyed to the captain, the room and the voyage
// epoch, so every captain gets their own market that is reproducible
// across a reload but different from everyone else's. That only holds
// while the draw depends on nothing but the seed and the charter, which
// is why the pools are passed in as an argument rather than read from
// mutable state, and why genMixedOrder is deliberately a pure function of
// the RNG alone.
//
// genRawOrder, genProductOrder and genMixedOrder are exported rather than
// private because Phase 2 (./orders) draws the trade board with the same
// generators. They were file-private before the split purely because
// everything lived in one file.
