/**
 * The Bartering phase's shared open-offer board: a thin relay around the
 * barter:* socket events (see src/server/realtime.ts), kept separate from
 * GameState the same way usePlayerDetail is, since an open offer is real
 * room-wide state no single client's deterministic engine can compute on
 * its own. This hook only tracks the board and tells the caller when a
 * trade closes; the actual inventory effect (escrow on post, credit/debit
 * on a completed trade, refund on cancel) is the caller's job via the
 * engine functions in src/lib/game/engine.ts.
 *
 * `onFulfilled` fires once for every trade involving me, on both sides:
 * as the accepter (pay the requested item, receive the offered one) and
 * as the original poster (receive the requested item, the offered side
 * was already escrowed away when the offer was posted). The caller tells
 * the two apart by comparing `accepterId` against its own user id.
