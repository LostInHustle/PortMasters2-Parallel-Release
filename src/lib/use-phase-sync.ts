 * behind a room-wide ready check. Calling `markReady` no longer runs the
 * transition immediately. It tells the server "I'm done here," and the
 * actual engine call only fires once every other room member has done
 * the same, via the `phase:advance` broadcast. Each client runs the exact
 * same deterministic transition locally, so everyone lands on the same
 * next phase without the server needing to know any game rules.
 *
 * Starting the voyage itself (phase 0, the lobby) is not part of that
 * vote. It is a one-time, host-only action gated on the room having at
 * least two members, handled by `startGame` below and answered with a
 * dedicated `room:started` broadcast rather than `phase:advance`, since
 * nobody but the host called anything and there is no per-client pending
 * action to resume. Every client just runs startBoonDrafting() the
 * moment they hear it.
