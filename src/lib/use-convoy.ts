/**
 * [MANIFEST 04: Convoy Ventures] The shared, multi round board of open
 * ventures: a thin relay around the venture:* socket events (see
 * src/server/realtime.ts), kept separate from GameState the same way
 * useBarter and useAid are, since an open venture is real room-wide state
 * no single client's deterministic engine can compute on its own. Unlike
 * barter and aid, this one is backed by a real database table server side
 * (a venture can outlive a single phase, even a single round), but the
 * client side shape here is deliberately identical to those two: a list,
 * a post, an action, and a callback for when something involving me
 * resolves. The actual Gold effect (escrow on contribute, credit on
 * settlement) is the caller's job via the engine functions in
 * src/lib/game/engine.ts.
 *
 * `onContributed` fires once, only on the client that just contributed,
 * telling it exactly how much of its requested amount actually landed (a
 * venture can be topped up by someone else microseconds earlier, so less
 * may have been needed than was asked to give). `onSettled` fires on every
 * client in the room whenever any venture resolves, for any of the three
 * outcomes above; the caller filters the settlements list for its own
 * userId to find out whether it was involved at all.
 *
 * `locked` reflects whether this room has already used its one Convoy
 * Venture chance for the current voyage (see hasRoomClaimedVenture in
 * src/server/realtime.ts): once true, posting a new venture will always be
 * rejected, and it only ever goes back to false on a fresh voyage.
