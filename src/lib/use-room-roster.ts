 * (MembersPanel's full roster and FleetTicker's strip) need exactly this, and
 * previously carried their own byte for byte copy of the dedupe and prune
 * logic below, so a fix to one silently missed the other.
 *
 * Every caller still subscribes on its own, exactly as before: this shares the
 * code, not the state, so mounting both panels behaves identically to the two
 * separate copies it replaces.
